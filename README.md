Bricktopia – International Webshop & Remote 3D Printing Platform
Welcome to Bricktopia, a collaborative international project combining web development and IoT. This platform allows users to order custom Lego pieces online, which are then 3D-printed remotely using a Raspberry Pi 3.

🌍 About the Project
This project was developed as part of an international collaboration between students from the Netherlands and Spain. The goal was to build a functional webshop where customers could order custom Lego pieces that would be 3D printed remotely via a Raspberry Pi 3.

In week 1, we traveled to Spain to kick off the project. During this phase, we:

Set up and configured a Raspberry Pi 3 connected to a 3D printer

Enabled remote access outside of the local network, allowing printing jobs to be submitted globally

In week 2, the Spanish team joined us in the Netherlands. We:

Developed the webshop frontend and backend

Created an admin dashboard to manage products and customer data

Tested and successfully printed Lego parts remotely from the Netherlands to Spain

Despite the short timeline (6 days of development) and the complexity, we secured second place 🥈 out of six teams, finishing only 2 points behind the winner.

👨‍💻 My Role
I was primarily responsible for:

Configuring the Raspberry Pi 3 to be remotely accessible via public IP, making it usable worldwide

Developing the webshop, leveraging my frontend and backend experience

Building the admin dashboard to manage orders and products

Ensuring end-to-end communication between the webshop and the 3D printer

This project allowed me to combine my passion for full-stack development and embedded systems. While the store and dashboard were not 100% complete, the core functionalities worked seamlessly, including remote 3D printing from another country.
